# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Ronnie Ng

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about creating an app based on what we want to make. The purpose of this blog is to write about my progress on creating my app.

## Content
For my project, Me and Wei Jie Jiang wanted to create a bulletin board application where you can share information with others online. In order to access all of the posts, the user first has to register their account and then login to be brought to the main page. In this page you can view others posts but can't edit or delete anyone elses but their own. The user can then create their own post by clicking the "create card" button at the top of the screen.

## Implications

Our app affects us Socially, Economically, and Globally.

How does our app affect us, and our community? Our app affects us because it can be used as a resource to help find out answers to any questions you have. Depending on what people post, it can provide useful information that you can use. You can also build relationships with others because when a person creates a post, the email of the person who posted it is shown. People can use this to connect with others if they feel that they share similarities or like the post. But, having a public bulletin board where you can post anything you want could be harmful because there could be people who will post explicit information. This explicit card can not be edited or deleted by anyone but the creator of that post or me and Wei Jie which means it can disturb others.

How does our app affect us Economically? Since our app can be used to upload anything you want, people can also use the cards as a way to create advertisement for anything you want. This could be an advertisement for jobs, games, or any kind of product which could promote businesses and consumer sales. This is not the greatest way to promote something because there isn't really an organizer so you can't find anything you specifically want. This could be harmful to the economy if anyone posts something that could be a scam or rip-off then it can cause others arm if they decide to buy them
