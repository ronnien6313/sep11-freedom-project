# Entry 6
##### 6/1/22

### Context 

After me and my partner Wei Jie finalized our MVP, we decided to create a simple login page and called it a day. After finishing our MVP our SEP Expo was coming up. The SEP Expo is an event where all the Juniors come together and share their creation in a gallery walk type of way. Although there were judges, It was mostly a chill, relaxing kind of event because nothing was going into the gradebook. It was mostly to check out everyone elses projects and be proud to show off what you made. However, After the expo came the in-class presentation, this one was a bit more serious since it does go into the gradebook and it was a one-mic kind of thing.

### SEP Expo

For the SEP Expo we had a lesson about elevator pitches. An elevator pitch is basically a 1 minute statement about our product / app. Here is our elevator pitch :

```
This project is made by me, Ronnie and Wei Jie. What we wanted to do is to create an app that can store information which can be shared with others. In order to accomplish this goal, me and Wei Jie decided to learn firebase so we can store information permanently in a database.

Here is how it works: You first create an account with an email and password, After logging in you can view other peoples posts on a page. You can create a post by clicking create card and add information on the post. After pressing add, The post is then public and can be viewed by anyone but only can be edited by the creator. Each post has a unique id that represents each user.

If you want to test out the project here is the link and a few test emails.
```

This basically summarizes our project but it sounded a bit too robot-y. What I mean by this is that it sounds unnatural when you speak it because we don't normally speak like this. If we were to say this word for word it would sound like we were reading them a paragraph out loud. During the Expo when the Judges came to our project, me and Wei Jie basically scrapped the elevator pitch and explained our project from our heart. It felt a lot less stressful because we didn't have to follow an exact script and it was more fun that way.

Here are the scores for my SEP Expo from the judges :

```
Creativity: 3.5
Usability: 3
Enjoyability(09)/Practicality(10/11/12): 3
Presentation: 3.5
```

### In-Class Presentation 

After the SEP Expo which was a more casual presentation, We had an in-class presentation that would be graded on a rubric. For this presentation, we had to create slides that had a hook slide, conclusion slide, and content slides. We had about a week to create these slides and they were done both in class and at home. There were some things that me and Wei Jie wanted to do with our slides, and one thing was that we wanted to make an interesting hook. We decided to compare our project to a "community bulletin board" where everyone can both share and view others' posts. We tried to make the presentation more visual and kind of funny so it wouldn't be too boring for the audience. Our slides basically had no words in them besides the code and pictures we had. We decided that we would explain everything by ourselves and use the pictures/code as a way to help the audience understand more. When presentation day came up, me and Wei Jie weren't really that prepared because we didn't have a good script of what we were going to say. So we decided that we would both have fun with it. Me and Wei Jie both winged our parts and it turned out really great because I tend to stutter a lot more when I'm trying to follow something. Since we didn't follow the script, we spoke from what we knew and added/made up new things on the spot. I feel like the presentation felt a lot more interactive and interesting that way because we weren't just bombarding everyone with information. We tried to make things a bit funny and lighthearted as well.

### Takeaways

My takeaway from both of these presentations is that you should speak from your heart and mind. We spent a lot of time on these projects so we know these projects best and sometimes following a script to explain just doesn't work out. I feel like speaking your mind and incorporating parts of your script is the best way to do it because when you follow a script, It could kind of sound monotone sometimes.

### EDP

I think that I am on the final stage of the EDP, EDP 8 - "Communicating the results". This basically just means that we are now presenting our "result" or our product, which we did for the past 2 weeks. It has been very fun and a great experience for me because we had nice feedback on our project which really helps boost our confidence.

### Skills

Two skills that I have learned from my presentations are creativity and attention to detail. Creativity because we wanted our slides to be a bit different, especially the hook. While making the hook, we really did make it different and it was definitely not what I was expecting. I'd also say attention to detail because we were creating slides so we have to make sure that every slide had everything we needed to explain our project smoothly.
