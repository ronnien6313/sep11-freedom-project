# Entry 6
##### 6/1/22

### Context 

After me and my partner Wei Jie finalized our MVP, we decided to create a simple login page and called it a day. After finishing our MVP our SEP Expo was coming up. The SEP Expo is an event where all the Juniors come together and share their creation in a gallery walk type of way. Although there were judges, It was mostly a chill, relaxing kind of event because nothing was going into the gradebook. It was mostly to check out everyone elses projects and be proud to show off what you made. However, After the expo came the in-class presentation, this one was a bit more serious since it does go into the gradebook and it was a one-mic kind of thing.

```
