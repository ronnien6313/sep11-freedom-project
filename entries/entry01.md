 This year, In SEP 11, we were tasked with creating some kind of app that we were passionate about utilizing a JavaScript tool. So the first step in creating an app, is to find out what kind of app I want to make. The first idea that popped up to me was creating something that can store information. But the problem was I didn't know what kind of information I wanted to store. So before going further with that, I decided to first find a JavaScript tool that could help me store information. The first thing that popped up was firebase because my teacher would always something along the lines of, "When creating an app that requires storing information, you would probably need firebase". So first thing I did was research about firebase and how to start learning it. So I searched up Firebase on Google, and turns out Google owns firebase. So the first thing I did was sign up for Google Firebase. After signing up for firebase I researched some of the options that firebase offers, and the one that stuck out to me was firestore. The reason behind this is because Firestore is one of the parts of Firebase that can store data. On my journey to learn a bit of Firestore, I went on youtube to search up some tutorials/demos. The one I specifically watch was [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d-gIPGzmK4&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9itfjle0ji1xOZ2cjRGY_WB) one.
 
 
 
 
 For example maybe something like a password storer or a planning app. 
 
 
 
 The reason behind it was because I want to be more organized and I have tons of passwords.
 
 
 
 The next part was thinking about what JavaScript tool I would be using. When thinking about storing information, My teacher Mr. Mueller always said that storing information usually relates to firebase. So the next thing I did was research about firebase, and the first thing that popped up was firebase from google.
